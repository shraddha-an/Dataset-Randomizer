Additional Info:

This is a Web Scraping Project implemented in Python using the Beautiful Soup library for parsing HTML documents.
I access the UCI Machine Learning Repository and view all the available datasets in list format.

The URL I used to scrape: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=nameUp&view=list

I parse the names of the datasets and their links into a dataframe. 
Then using the randint method in numpy.random module, I generate a random number as index to access the link.

This link, stored as a string, can be used to access the dataset via your browser.
