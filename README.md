# Dataset-Randomizer
This code generates the link to a random dataset from a list of datasets at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

If you are new to Data Science or Machine Learning like I am, then you probably need to practice your skills
on a variety of datasets.

For this purpose, I created a short piece of code that takes as a list all the datasets (and their links) available at the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and outputs one link randomly from this list.

I decided to implement this as a fun way to challenge myself and work on some new dataset every day to improve my ML skills.

Hope you find it useful.
